# Stock Prediction RCNN Model
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a stock prediction model using a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN). The model aims to predict future stock prices based on historical price data and other relevant features.

## Features
Utilizes a combination of convolutional and recurrent layers to extract temporal and spatial features from historical stock data.
Implements attention mechanisms to focus on important temporal features.
Includes functionality to preprocess and clean input data, handle missing values, and normalize features.
Offers configurable hyperparameters to fine-tune the model's performance.
Provides visualization tools to analyze model predictions and performance metrics.
## Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
## Usage
### Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
### Prepare your dataset:

Ensure your dataset is in a suitable format, including historical stock prices and relevant features.
Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and normalize features.
### Train the model:

Use the provided training script to train the RCNN model on your dataset.
bash
Copy code
python train.py --dataset <path_to_dataset>
### Evaluate the model:

Evaluate the trained model's performance using test data and appropriate metrics.
bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py --model <path_to_model> --test_data <path_to_test_data>
### Make predictions:

Use the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data.
bash
Copy code
python predict.py --model <path_to_model> --input_data <path_to_input_data>
