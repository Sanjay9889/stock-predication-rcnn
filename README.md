# Stock Prediction RCNN Model
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a stock prediction model using a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN). The model aims to predict future stock prices based on historical price data and other relevant features.

## Features
Utilizes a combination of convolutional and recurrent layers to extract temporal and spatial features from historical stock data.
Implements attention mechanisms to focus on important temporal features.
Includes functionality to preprocess and clean input data, handle missing values, and normalize features.
Offers configurable hyperparameters to fine-tune the model's performance.
Provides visualization tools to analyze model predictions and performance metrics.
## Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
## Usage
